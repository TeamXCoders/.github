### TEAM X CODERS  

#### Who Are We?  
We’re a team of developers diving into  Node.js applications, figuring out how they work, and bringing them back to life. Whether it’s a legacy app that’s been neglected or code that’s difficult to untangle, we’re here to make sense of it and restore it to working order.  

#### What We Do  
- **Reverse Engineering**  
  We analyze applications inside and out to understand how they were built. This helps us recover lost code, identify and fix issues, or improve outdated systems.  

- **Restoring Node.js Applications**  
  When apps fall into disrepair, we step in. We fix bugs, update dependencies, and get everything running smoothly again, ensuring the app is ready for use.  

- **Modernizing and Improving Apps**  
  While we’re restoring apps, we also make them better—improving performance, updating features, and ensuring they’re built for today’s needs.  

- **Tailored Solutions**  
  Every app is different, and so are the challenges. We adapt our approach to fit what’s needed, whether that’s restoring lost functionality or building something completely new.  

#### Why It Matters  
Sometimes, important systems get left behind or break down. Our focus is on understanding what’s there and making it work again, no matter how complicated things get. We enjoy the process of solving tough problems and giving apps a second chance to thrive.
